# Meme Generator

A simple meme generator written using HTML, CSS, Javascript using the React library.

Meme images are fetched using Imgflip's free API.
URL: https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes

Text inputted in the left box will be put at the top of the image.

Text inputted in the right box will be put at the bottom of the image.

This is one of my first React Project, as I'm learning about the library.

This project is also my first time studying about and implementing API calls.
